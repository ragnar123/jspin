Welcome to the jSpin project.

jSpin is a development environment for Spin that is an alternative to XSpin and is intended for use by students. SpinSpider will be useful for teachers of concurrency who wish to display the state space of a Promela model.

The projects are stable, but I would be interested in hearing from users of jSpin and I will consider any modifications or improvements that are suggested.
